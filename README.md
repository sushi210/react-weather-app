# 🌤️ React Weather App
A responsive weather web app built with Vite and React. Uses Open Meteo for weather data and OpenCage for geocoding.

## 🛠️ APIs

Weather data is from **OpenMeteo** (https://open-meteo.com/).

I used **OpenCage Geocoding** (https://opencagedata.com/) to convert place names into coordinates.

* **Note:** You will need to obtain a key from **OpenCage** and set it up as an environment variable in a `.env` file (e.g., `VITE_OPENCAGE_API_KEY`).
